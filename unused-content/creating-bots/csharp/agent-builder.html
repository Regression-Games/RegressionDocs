You can think of a behavior tree as a flow chart that the AI follows, choosing appropriate actions based on what it knows about itself and its environment.
A behavior tree is composed of nodes organized into a hierarchical structure which starts with a root node and branches out to form different paths.
Each path represents a line of decision-making that results in one or more actions for the AI to perform.</p><p>Each node in the tree executes logic and returns one of the following statuses as a result:</p><ul><li><strong>Running</strong> -&gt; The task represented by this node&#x27;s branch hasn&#x27;t yet completed.</li><li><strong>Success</strong> -&gt; The node has completed its task successfully.</li><li><strong>Failure</strong> -&gt; The node has failed its task. This doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean an error occurred. For example, a heal action might fail if the character doesn&#x27;t have any potions.</li></ul><p>Different types of nodes have different responsibilities and may react differently to the statuses of other nodes.</p><ul><li><strong>Root Node</strong>: The beginning of the tree, where the AI starts its decision-making.
Its job is simply to execute whatever node is below it in the tree and return its status.</li><li><strong>Sequence Node</strong>: This node has one or more children and acts as a logical AND.
It executes its child nodes sequentially, and if any one of them fail then the Sequence Node immediately returns a failure status, skipping execution of any remaining children.</li><li><strong>Selector Node</strong>: This node also has one or more children, but acts as a logical OR.
It executes its child nodes sequentially, and if any one of them succeed then the Selector Node immediately returns a success status, skipping execution of any remaining children.
If none succeed, then the Selector Node returns a failure status instead.</li><li><strong>Action Node</strong>: This node is a leaf node, meaning it cannot have any children of its own.
This node represents an action for the AI to perform such as moving in a certain direction or interacting with an object in its environment.</li><li><strong>Condition Node</strong>: This node is also a leaf node. It evaluates whether one or more pre-conditions have been satisfied for a specific action.</li><li><strong>Decorator Node</strong>: There are several kinds of Decorator Nodes, each of which can have only one child. These nodes modify the child&#x27;s status in some way.
For example, an &quot;Inverter&quot; Decorator will succeed if its child fails, and vice versa.</li></ul><p>Let&#x27;s consider a practical example where we want our AI to talk to another character.
The &quot;conversation&quot; branch should fail if there isn&#x27;t anyone to talk to.
Perhaps the character can&#x27;t see anyone else from where they&#x27;re standing, or perhaps everyone present is already engaged in conversation.
Returning the failure status allows our AI to evaluate other branches for potential actions.
Keep in mind that the conversation branch may fail even if it does find a valid target -
for instance, if the character we want to talk to is too far away, then the AI will need to approach them first.
If all preconditions for talking to the character are met, and we initiate conversation, then the branch will return the success status.
This indicates that the branch has accomplished its tasks and that we can evaluate other branches for things like choosing a conversation topic.</p><p>What about the running status? This status is unique in that a parent node will immediately return running if any of its children return running,
essentially short-circuiting the tree. This is useful in cases where the action an AI wants to perform isn&#x27;t instantaneous.
For example, initiating conversation with another character might trigger a greeting animation which takes several seconds to play out.
Our conversation branch could check whether the AI is in the middle of a greeting animation before evaluating other preconditions,
preventing it from repeating logic from this branch.</p><p>For a deeper dive into behavior trees, their nodes, and practical examples of their usage in video games, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/behavior-trees-for-ai-how-they-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">follow this link</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="creating-a-bot">Creating a Bot<a href="#creating-a-bot" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Creating a Bot" title="Direct link to Creating a Bot">​</a></h2><p>Create a new AI from the Bot Manager and select <code>Agent Builder</code> from the list of creation options,
