# Regression Games for Unity

**Regression Games is developing the tools and standards that will make effective and easy end-to-end automated testing of games a reality.**

Most games suffer from a lack of automated testing, and the complex nature of games often constrains the testing that is done to small and simple scenarios.

We are imagining a future where automated tests can handle the most complex and repetitive scenarios, freeing up valuable time for developers to focus on
the most challenging and creative aspects of game development. By combining old school algorithms, cutting-edge machine learning techniques, and a focus
on the developer experience, Regression Games is building tools that make this end-to-end testing possible.

## What is our vision?

Our vision for this framework is that a members of development and QA teams in game studios can collaborate to create tests for their games that are both highly reliable and easy to maintain. 

Automated testing of games is challenging due to the complexity and dynamic behavior of games. This is why we
provide a variety of approaches to create **bots** that can handle the unique constraints of your game. We aren't locked into either old school
AI approaches or LLMs, but rather utilize any technique when it will actually result in a bot that can test your game reliably.

There are three core principles driving the development of this framework:
* Ease of use - developers should be able to integrate and create new tests with minimal effort.
* Reliability - the framework should be designed to be reliable, whether that means providing approaches that are robust to dynamic scenarios, or giving developers the ability to identify and fix flaky tests.
* Data driven - the framework collects a wide variety of data, used in both testing and bot building.

## Highlighted Features

The table below highlights some of the main features of the framework.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Plug-and-Play Setup | Simply add our SDK and add one GameObject to your scene to begin instantly collecting detailed information for tests and bots. Custom integration code is rarely needed. |
| Get Started Quickly with Session Recording | Developers can create a new test simply by recording a play through of their scenario. |
| Computer Vision Capabilities | In some cases, a bot needs to see the game to understand it. Our CV capabilities can extract information from game screenshots to help drive bot behavior and validate game state using approaches like OCR and object detection. |
| Exploratory Testing | The framework collects a wide variety of data, used in both testing and bot building. |
| Composability | One approach is not always adequate for automating a certain test scenario. Our drag and drop tool allows you to stitch together and re-use bot logic across tests. |
| Runtime, CI/CD, and Editor Compatibility | Our tools work in the Editor, in builds, and within CI/CD. Because of our integration approach, in most cases you will **not need to restart your game** to iterate on a test scenario. |
| Data Exploration and Validation | Our dashboard allows developers to inspect and test the state of their game in a no-code fashion. |

## Where do I started?

The best place to start is with our [installation guide](getting-started/installing-regression-games). Once the package is added, you can [create your first
test automation](getting-started/creating-your-first-automated-test).
