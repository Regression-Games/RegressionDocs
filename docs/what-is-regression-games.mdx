# Regression Games

Regression Games makes it easy to create automated tests for your game.

## Highlighted Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Plug-and-Play Setup](getting-started/installing-regression-games) | Simply import our SDK package and add one GameObject to your scene to instantly begin using our tools. Custom integration code is rarely needed to get started. |
| [Get Started Quickly with Recording and Input Playback](getting-started/creating-your-first-automated-test) | Create functional tests by recording a play-through of your scenario and performing validations against automated playback. |
| [Computer Vision Capabilities](guides/interacting-with-ui-using-computer-vision) | In some cases, a bot needs to _see_ your game to understand it. Our CV capabilities, such as OCR and object detection, can extract information from in-game screenshots to help drive behaviors and validate game state during runtime. |
| [Exploratory Testing](guides/finding-game-breaking-bugs-with-stability-testing) | Run more than just predefined scenarios - tools such as our Monkey Bot can dynamically explore your game to find edge cases. |
| [Composability](core-concepts/bot-sequences/getting-started-with-bot-sequences-and-segments) | Define re-usable units of bot logic that perform a range of actions such as simulating inputs, invoking MonoBehaviours, and performing assertions against the game state. Then, stitch them together with our drag-and-drop tool to form different tests.  |
| [Runtime, CI/CD, and Editor Compatibility](core-concepts/running-tests-in-the-unity-test-runner) | Use our tools in the Editor, in builds, and within CI/CD. |
| [Inspect and Validate Game State](core-concepts/validation-suites) | Review your recorded gameplay's screenshots, user inputs, and internal game state through our dashboard. Use these views to create test suites using no-code solutions. |

## Where Do I Start?

See our [live validations demo](https://play.regression.gg/validations-demo) for a peek into the tools our SDK can unlock for your game. Once you are ready to hop in, follow the
[installation guide](getting-started/installing-regression-games) and
[create your first automated test](getting-started/creating-your-first-automated-test).

## Our Mission

Our mission is to transform the landscape of game development by tackling one of its most persistent challenges: automated testing.

Our tools and standards will make effective end-to-end automated testing of games a reality, in a way that actually saves you time and pain. We imagine a future where automated tests handle most functional testing scenarios, freeing up valuable time for developers to focus on the more challenging and creative aspects of game development. Regression Games is making this possible by combining old school algorithms, cutting-edge machine learning techniques, and a focus on the developer experience.

Our vision is to build tools with the community that actually help you be more productive. There are three core principles driving the development of this framework:
- **Ease of use** - Developers should be able to integrate and create new tests with minimal effort.
- **Reliability** - In the dynamic world of games, reliability is key. Our framework is designed to handle the unexpected and give you the tools to create robust, dependable tests.
- **Data driven** - Our framework collects comprehensive data, empowering you to build smarter automations and create more effective tests.

Automated testing of games is challenging due to the complexity and dynamic behavior of games. This is why we
provide a variety of approaches to create **bots** that can handle the unique constraints of your game. We aren't locked into either old school
AI approaches or LLMs, but rather utilize any technique when it will actually result in a bot that can test your game reliably.
