# Regression Games

Regression Games is making it easy to create automated tests for your game.

## Highlighted Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Plug-and-Play Setup](getting-started/installing-regression-games) | Simply install our SDK and add one GameObject to your scene to instantly begin using our tools. Custom integration code is rarely needed to get started. |
| [Get Started Quickly with Recording and Input Playback](getting-started/creating-your-first-automated-test) | Developers can create functional tests by recording a play-through of their scenario and preforming validations against automated playback. |
| [Computer Vision Capabilities](guides/interacting-with-ui-using-computer-vision) | In some cases, a bot needs to see the game to understand it. Our CV capabilities, such as OCR and object detection, can extract information from in-game screenshots to help drive behaviors and validate game state during runtime. |
| [Exploratory Testing](guides/finding-game-breaking-bugs-with-stability-testing) | Run more than just predefined scenarios - exploratory bots such as the Monkey Bot can explore edge cases within your game. |
| [Composability](core-concepts/bot-sequences/getting-started-with-bot-sequences-and-segments) | One approach is not always adequate for automating a certain test scenario. Our drag and drop tool allows you to stitch together and re-use bot logic across tests. |
| [Runtime, CI/CD, and Editor Compatibility](core-concepts/running-tests-in-the-unity-test-runner) | Our tools work in the Editor, in builds, and within CI/CD. Because of our integration approach, in most cases you will **not need to restart your game** to iterate on a test scenario. |
| [Data Exploration and Validation](core-concepts/validation-suites) | Our dashboard allows developers to inspect and test the state of their game in a no-code fashion. |

## Where do I start?

The best place to start is with our [installation guide](getting-started/installing-regression-games). Once our SDK is added to your project, you can [create your first
test automation](getting-started/creating-your-first-automated-test).

If you are already familiar with the framework, check out these more advanced guides for test inspiration:

* [Interacting with User Interfaces using Computer Vision](guides/interacting-with-ui-using-computer-vision)
* [Finding Game-Breaking Bugs with Stability Testing](guides/finding-game-breaking-bugs-with-stability-testing)
* [Writing Advanced Validations](guides/writing-advanced-validations)
* [Running Tests in Editor and in Builds](guides/running-tests-in-editor-and-in-builds)

You can also check out our [existing game samples](additional-game-samples) or the [live demo of our validation tool](https://play.regression.gg/validations-demo).

## Our Mission

Our mission is to transform the landscape of game development by tackling one of its most persistent challenges: automated testing.

Our tools and standards will make effective end-to-end automated testing of games a reality, in a way that actually saves you time and pain. We imagine a future where automated tests handle most functional testing scenarios, freeing up valuable time for developers to focus on the more challenging and creative aspects of game development. Regression Games is making this possible by combining old school algorithms, cutting-edge machine learning techniques, and a focus on the developer experience.

Our vision is to build tools with the community that actually help you be more productive. There are three core principles driving the development of this framework:
- **Ease of use** - Developers should be able to integrate and create new tests with minimal effort.
- **Reliability** - In the dynamic world of games, reliability is key. Our framework is designed to handle the unexpected and give you the tools to create robust, dependable tests.
- **Data driven** - Our framework collects comprehensive data, empowering you to build smarter automations and create more effective tests.

Automated testing of games is challenging due to the complexity and dynamic behavior of games. This is why we
provide a variety of approaches to create **bots** that can handle the unique constraints of your game. We aren't locked into either old school
AI approaches or LLMs, but rather utilize any technique when it will actually result in a bot that can test your game reliably.
