# Regression Games

Regression Games is on a mission to transform the landscape of game development by tackling one of its most persistent challenges: automated testing.

We are developing the tools and standards that will make effective end-to-end automated testing of games a reality, in a way that actually saves you
time and pain. We are imagining a future where automated tests can handle the most complex and repetitive scenarios, freeing up valuable time for developers to focus on
the most challenging and creative aspects of game development. By combining old school algorithms, cutting-edge machine learning techniques, and a focus
on the developer experience, Regression Games is building tools that make this end-to-end testing possible.

- **Unleash Your Creativity:** By automating complex and repetitive testing scenarios, we free up your time to focus on what truly matters - creating amazing bug-free games.
- **Cutting-Edge Technology:** We blend traditional algorithms with state-of-the-art machine learning, creating a powerful synergy that tackles the unique challenges of game testing.
- **Developer-Centric Approach:** Our tools are built by developers, for developers. We understand your pain points and have crafted solutions that seamlessly integrate into your workflow.

## What is our vision?

It's not secret that development teams are hesitant to adopt automated testing. If not done correctly, tests can become a burden rather than a way
to supercharge your development process.

Our vision is to build tools with the community that actually help you be more productive. There are four core principles driving the development of this framework:
- **Ease of use** - Developers should be able to integrate and create new tests with minimal effort.
- **Reliability** - In the dynamic world of games, reliability is key. Our framework is designed to handle the unexpected and give you the tools to create robust, dependable tests.
- **Data driven** - Our framework collects comprehensive data, empowering you to build smarter automations and create more effective tests.

Automated testing of games is challenging due to the complexity and dynamic behavior of games. This is why we
provide a variety of approaches to create **bots** that can handle the unique constraints of your game. We aren't locked into either old school
AI approaches or LLMs, but rather utilize any technique when it will actually result in a bot that can test your game reliably.

## Highlighted Features

The table below highlights some of the main features of the framework.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Plug-and-Play Setup](getting-started/installing-regression-games) | Simply add our SDK and add one GameObject to your scene to begin instantly collecting detailed information for tests and bots. Custom integration code is rarely needed to get started. |
| [Get Started Quickly with Session Recording](getting-started/creating-your-first-automated-test) | Developers can create a new test simply by recording a play through of their scenario. |
| [Computer Vision Capabilities](guides/interacting-with-ui-using-computer-vision) | In some cases, a bot needs to see the game to understand it. Our CV capabilities can extract information from game screenshots to help drive bot behavior and validate game state using approaches like OCR and object detection. |
| [Exploratory Testing](guides/finding-game-breaking-bugs-with-stability-testing) | The framework collects a wide variety of data, used in both testing and bot building. |
| [Composability](core-concepts/bot-sequences/getting-started-with-bot-sequences-and-segments) | One approach is not always adequate for automating a certain test scenario. Our drag and drop tool allows you to stitch together and re-use bot logic across tests. |
| [Runtime, CI/CD, and Editor Compatibility](core-concepts/running-tests-in-the-unity-test-runner) | Our tools work in the Editor, in builds, and within CI/CD. Because of our integration approach, in most cases you will **not need to restart your game** to iterate on a test scenario. |
| [Data Exploration and Validation](core-concepts/validation-suites) | Our dashboard allows developers to inspect and test the state of their game in a no-code fashion. |

## Where do I start?

The best place to start is with our [installation guide](getting-started/installing-regression-games). Once the package is added, you can [create your first
test automation](getting-started/creating-your-first-automated-test).
