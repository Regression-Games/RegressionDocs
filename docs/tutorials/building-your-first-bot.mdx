# Writing Your First Automated Test

In this tutorial, we will get a simple automated test working in Unity using Regression Games. We will show you:

- How to integrate the RG Unity SDK into your game
- Record a gameplay session as an automated test
- Create a test scenario and run that against future test runs

## Download the sample game

Feel free to follow this tutorial within your own game, but we recommend starting with a sample game. Our team often uses
BossRoom, a simple multiplayer game created by Unity. However, you can also start with any game of your choosing!

Download the BossRoom sample from the [official GitHub repository.](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop)

:::info

Note that there are some limitations of the package that may not work with your game. For instance, our framework
works best with the New Unity Input System and games that use standard UI canvas elements and game objects. Learn
more about these limitations in our [Gameplay Session recording docs](/gameplay-sessions/gameplay-sessions-getting-started#known-limitations).

:::

Open it within Unity version 2022.3 (visit the [Unity archive](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2022.3.27) if
you can't find that version from Unity Hub). Once the project is loaded, open the **MainMenu** scene within
**Assets** > **Scenes** > **MainMenu**.

## Import the Regression Games Unity Bots package

You can find [our package on GitHub](https://github.com/Regression-Games/RGUnityBots). Import the package into your Unity project by opening 
the **Package Manager** window (**Window** > **Package Manager**) and click **Add package from git URL**. Then, paste the following URL:

```
https://github.com/Regression-Games/RGUnityBots.git?path=src/gg.regression.unity.bots#v0.0.19
```

:::info

- This package utilizes TextMeshPro.  If you are prompted by Unity to add TextMeshPro assets to your project, please add them.
- This package installs a dependency of Newtonsoft Json (https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json@3.1/manual/index.html) for serializing/deserializing Json message payloads.
- If you get a note about Unity's new input system, click **Yes** and allow the editor to restart.

:::

After importing the package, you will be greeted by a login screen. Create an account at
[https://play.regression.gg](https://play.regression.gg) and login to Unity with your account credentials. If you need to login again in the future, 
you can enter your login info by visiting the **Regression Games** > **Getting Started** menu.

## Restart Unity and your IDE

After installing the Regression Games Unity Bots package and its dependencies into Unity, please restart Unity 
and your code editor (e.g. Rider or Visual Studio). Without this step, Unity and your code editor may not properly 
resolve the new packages even after Unity recompiles the scripts.

## Record a gameplay session

The first step in automating a test is to record a gameplay session. This feature allows you to record real gameplay
and play it back later as an automated test. Regression Games does offer other utilities for dynamic bots, but to get
started with a simple example, we will record a click-through that verifies the functionality of the UI in BossRoom.

### Add the RGOverlayCanvas

The RGOverlayCanvasV2 prefab provides an overlay that allows you to begin recording gameplay sessions.

<OverlayPartial />

Once the overlay has been added to your scene(s), you can click play to see it in action!
Click the Regression Games logo at the bottom of the Scene View to open the overlay.

:::info

Your scene must have an EventSystem to make interaction with the overlay possible. You can add one by
right-clicking in your scene's Hierarchy and selecting **GameObject** > **UI** > **Event System**.
If you are using the sample scene we provide, this is already included.
