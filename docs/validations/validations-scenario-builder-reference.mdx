# Scenario Builder Reference

Scenarios are composed of one or more steps that can be asserted throughout a gameplay recording. Steps are asserted in the order they appear in the Scenario, and if any step fails, the Scenario will fail.

Aside from waiting for specific game states, you can also store values to be used in later steps.

## Step Types

### Wait for Scene

Wait for a specific scene to be loaded to be loaded or unloaded.

### Wait for Key

Wait for one or more keys to be pressed or released.

### Wait for Mouse

Wait for a mouse button to be pressed or released.

### Wait for Existence

Wait for a specified number of game objects, of a specific type, to exist or not exist.

### Wait for State

Wait for a specified number of game objects, of a specific type, to have state values that match a comparison. This comparison can either be a manually input value, or a stored value from a previous step.

### Store Value

Store a game object's state value to be used in later steps.
