# Rules Reference

Rules can be asserted against a gameplay recording to ensure that the recording meets specific criteria. We provide a set of rule types that can be used to construct assertions based on various performance metrics.

Rules belong to a Validation Suite, and are asserted each time the Validation Suite is run.

## Rule Types

### Frames Per Second (with percentile)

Assert that the frames per second of the gameplay recording are above a threshold, within a specified percentile.

### Average Frames Per Second

Assert that the average frames per second of the gameplay recording is above a threshold.

### Maximum Frame Time

Assert that the maximum frame time of the gameplay recording is below a threshold.
