The Regression Games Automated Testing Package for Unity is a set of tools that help you test your game with less code. The package combines several powerful features to help you test your game:

1. Automatic State Capture and Recording - Regression Games automatically discovers components in your game and allows you to make recordings of their state throughout a gameplay session. These recordings can be analyzed to determine if your game is behaving as expected.

1. Simple Automation Framework - Regression Games provides a simple framework for automating gameplay, and provides built-in automations for common tasks such as navigating menus.
