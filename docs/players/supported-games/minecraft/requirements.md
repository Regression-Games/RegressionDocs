# Requirements to Play Minecraft on Regression Games

In order to begin building AIs for Minecraft, you'll need a [Regression Games account](https://play.regression.gg),
a valid [Minecraft account](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/login) and a copy of [Minecraft: Java Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-bedrock-edition-pc).
Download the game launcher, then install **Minecraft version 1.18.2**.
It is important to use this specific version with Regression Games because our plugins may be incompatible with other versions.

Next, we recommend you create a [GitHub account](https://www.github.com) if you don't already have one.
Regression Games uses GitHub to save and load the AIs you create. This offers the smoothest experience for your AI experimentation after some initial setup.
However, if you'd rather manage files on your own, [you can upload your AI as a .zip file](TODO-REG-1035:-Add-section-and-link-here).
We will prompt you to connect a GitHub account when you first sign up for Regression Games, but you can skip this step and revisit it at any time from your profile page.
