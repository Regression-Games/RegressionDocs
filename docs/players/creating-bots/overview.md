# Overview

Regression Games uses GitHub to save, load, and version your AIs. Our platform detects changes to your AI through GitHub in real-time. 
This means that if your AI is playing in a practice match, we will automatically refresh it, and you'll be able to see your updates almost instantly.

Regression Games offers multiple tools for creating AIs from a block-style programming interface to a custom library 
that allows programmers of all skill-levels to bring their imaginations to life. 
Note that these tools generally leverage GitHub and may not be available to users who choose to opt out.
For users who prefer not to use GitHub, we offer the ability to [upload your AI as a .zip file](TODO-REG-1035:-Add-section-and-link-here).
