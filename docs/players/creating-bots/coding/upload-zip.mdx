# Uploading Your AI as a ZIP File

This section describes how to manually upload an AI project that you're managing locally or via a GitHub account that you haven't linked to Regression Games.

## Preparing Your Project

Once you've read the [Development Dependencies & Requirements](./dev-requirements) section, created an AI project, 
and made some changes to test out in-game, then you'll need to compress your project using the `.zip` format.

If you're pushing your project to GitHub, then you can navigate to your repository and click the "Code" button and then "Download as ZIP".

If you're managing your project locally, then compress the project into a ZIP yourself.

:::info
Exclude the `node_modules` folder from your ZIP file. 
This folder contains all of the Node dependencies that your code requires in order to run, and these can become quite large.
Regression Games automatically retrieves these dependencies for you when your bot is loaded into a game.

## Creating an AI from a ZIP File

Log into Regression Games and create a new AI from the Bot Manager. 

![Create new AI](../../../common/bot-creation/img/create-bot-button.png)

Select the option "I will upload a zip file of my bot code" from the available list.
Give your bot a name and use the "Select File" button to upload your ZIP file.
Select the correct programming language for your project then click "Create Bot".
It's that simple!

## Updating Your AI

The first ZIP file you upload for an AI likely won't be its final form.
After making modifications to your project, create a fresh ZIP file and then find your existing bot through the Regression Games' Bot Manager.
From here, you can see the current file's size and when it was uploaded, download a copy of it, and select a new ZIP file to replace it.
You can change your current file as many times as you want until you've achieved your AI masterpiece.

:::caution
Regression Games __does not__ keep a historical record of your uploaded ZIP files or their contents.
Make sure you have a copy of your current bot code saved before overwriting it, so that you can revert your changes if needed.
