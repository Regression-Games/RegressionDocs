# Setting up QA Bots with GitHub Actions

This tutorial will walk you through setting up a QA Bot for your Unity project using GitHub Actions. This tutorial assumes you have
some familiarity with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), and that you have a working bot within your
game (see more on this within the [Creating your first bot guide](/studios/unity/unity-sdk/creating-bots/configuration)). 
You can find a working example in [this repository](google.com) for reference.

:::caution

This guide and reference is subject to change, as the product is in an **early preview**. We
are making changes based on your recommendations and feedback, so let us know what you think at
info@regression.gg, or join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/925SYVse2H).

:::info

This features requires a license for Unity, since CI/CD builds for Unity are only available if you have
a license for Unity. Additionally, if you want to use your existing CI/CD pipelines, the best reference
here is the environment variable and test function sections below.

:::

## Overview

In this guide, we will use GitHub Actions, GameCI, and Regression Games to set up a QA Bot for your Unity project. Whenever a new
push is made within your project, the Unity project will be built and a bot will be started. The steps to this
guide are as follows:

1. Add the GitHub Actions workflow files to your project needed to get Unity builds to work.
2. Configuring the GitHub Actions workflow files to work with GameCI and Regression Games.
3. Add a test to your Unity project that will start and run your bot.
4. Learn more about how to view test results.

## Add GitHub Action Workflow Files

We use the [GameCI](https://game.ci/) project as a foundation for running GitHub CI/CD builds for Unity. The GameCI project provides a collection of GitHub Actions that are used to build Unity projects.

#### 1. Create a new branch in your project called `qa-tests`.

#### 2. Follow the steps on GameCI to activate a [Unity License](https://game.ci/docs/github/activation).

It is critical that you follow this step! This allows the CI/CD Docker images to properly start and use Unity.
You can test that the license is configured properly by running this [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unity-activate)
in your project.

#### 3. Add the QA Bot workflow file to your project.

The QA Bot workflow file is a GitHub Action that will build your Unity project and start a test that will run a bot. From step 2 above,
you should have a `.github/workflows` folder. Inside of this folder, create a new file called `qa-bot.yml` and paste the contents below.

```yaml
#file: .github/workflows/qa-bot.yml

name: Regression Games Bots QA ðŸ¤–

on: [push]

# See https://game.ci/docs/github/test-runner and RG_DOCS for more info
jobs:
  build:
    name: Build my project âœ¨
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions: write-all # This is to allow writing results into the artifacts section of GitHub Actions
    steps:
          
      # Checkout (without LFS)
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Git LFS
      - name: Create LFS file list
        run: git lfs ls-files -l | cut -d' ' -f1 | sort > .lfs-assets-id

      - name: Restore LFS cache
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        id: lfs-cache
        with:
          path: .git/lfs
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-lfs-${{ hashFiles('.lfs-assets-id') }}

      - name: Git LFS Pull
        run: |
          git lfs pull
          git add .
          git reset --hard

      # Cache
      - uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: Library
          key: Library-${{ hashFiles('Assets/**', 'Packages/**', 'ProjectSettings/**') }}
          restore-keys: |
            Library-

      # Test
      # See https://game.ci/docs/github/test-runner for more information
      - name: Run tests
        uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v2
        env:
          UNITY_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.UNITY_LICENSE }}
        with:
          customParameters: -RG_BOT ${{ secrets.RG_BOT }} -RG_API_KEY ${{ secrets.RG_API_KEY }} -RG_HOST ${{ secrets.RG_HOST }}
          githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      # Output
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: Build
          path: build
```

:::info

Note that this will actually run all of your tests, not just the QA Bot test. To configure this workflow to only
run the QA test, see the [Unity Test Runner Command Line docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@2.0/manual/reference-command-line.html),
which has filter options that can be passed within `customParameters` within the `Run tests` step above.

:::

## Configure GitHub Actions

The final piece on the GitHub actions side is to configure the secrets that are used in the workflow file above. Visit the secrets
page for your project by going to your **Repo** > **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**. Add the following secrets
by clicking the green **New repository secret** button.

1. `RG_HOST` - `https://play.regression.gg`
2. `RG_API_KEY` - Your API key from Regression Games, which can be found in your [account settings](https://play.regression.gg/account).
                  Full instructions for this can be found in the [Authentication docs.](studios/api_reference/authentication).
3. `RG_BOT` - The ID of the bot you want to run. Within the [Bot Manager page](https://play.regression.gg/bots), you can see the ID
              for a bot in its details below the name of the bot.

![Bot ID](./github_actions_images/bot_id.png)

Once you are done adding these secrets, your secrets section should look similar to the following:

![Secrets for GitHub Actions](./github_actions_images/secrets.png)

## Add a Test to Your Unity Project

The QA Bots are started via a the [Unity Test Runner as a Play Mode test](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.1/Documentation/Manual/PlaymodeTestFramework.html). 
In this testing mode, the game starts as if you are playing it, and then terminates once the function finishes.

Complete the following steps to setup the required test - feel free to skip some of these steps if you have existing Play tests
in your project.

#### 1. Add your scenes to your build

Before adding the test, make sure your desired test scenes are placed inside your build. You can add your scenes to the build
using the menu option **File** > **Build Settings**.

![Build settings](./github_actions_images/build.png)

#### 2. Configure Test Runner for your project

Next, we need to configure the Unity Test Runner for your project. To do this, go to **Window** > **General** > **Test Runner**.
Then, in the pane that open, click **Play Mode** > **Create PlayMode Test Assembly Folder**. Create that tests folder with
the name `Tests`, and then open that folder in your editor. You should see a file called `Tests.asmdef` - open that file and 
replace it with the contents below, which will include Regression Games as a dependency:

```json
{
    "name": "Tests",
    "references": [
        "RegressionGames"
    ],
    "optionalUnityReferences": [
        "TestAssemblies"
    ]
}
```

You can learn more about the Test Runner and setup instructions [here](https://docs.unity.cn/560/Documentation/Manual/testing-editortestsrunner.html).

#### 3. Create an `RGBotTests` file to run your bot

Within the `Tests` folder, create a new file called `RGBotTests.cs` and copy the following contents into the file.

:::caution

Make sure to edit the file below to use the correct starting scene for your test! Update `Scenes/SampleScene` to
instead be the scene you are starting with.

Also, update `defaultBotId` to an ID of a bot that you'd like to start in your local editor. Remember, you can find
the ID of a bot within the [Bot Manager page](https://play.regression.gg/bots).

:::

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using RegressionGames;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;
using UnityEngine.TestTools;

public class RGBotTests
{
    [UnityTest]
    public IEnumerator RunBotTest()
    {
        
        // Override this to change how long a test will wait for bots to join before failing
        const int TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS = 60;

        // For in-editor purposes, feel free to define a default bot to use!
        int defaultBotId = 1000015;

        // NOTE: Make sure to fill in the name of the scene to start your test with!
        AsyncOperation asyncLoadLevel = SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync("Scenes/SampleScene", LoadSceneMode.Single);
        // Wait until the scene finishes loading, then wait a frame so every Awake and Start method is called
        while (!asyncLoadLevel.isDone)
            yield return null;
        yield return new WaitForEndOfFrame();

        // Grab the bot to start (override with the one from CI/CD if defined)
        if (RGEnvConfigs.ReadBotId() != null)
        {
            defaultBotId = Int32.Parse(RGEnvConfigs.ReadBotId());
        }
        int[] botIds = {defaultBotId};
        Debug.Log($"Running test with bots {string.Join(", ", botIds)}");
        
        // Start the bots
        RGBotServerListener.GetInstance().StartGame();
        Task.WhenAll(botIds.Select(delegate(int botId)
        {
            Debug.Log("Creating task to spawn bot with ID " + botId);
            return RGServiceManager.GetInstance()
                .QueueInstantBot((long) botId, (botInstance) =>
                {
                    RGBotServerListener.GetInstance().AddClientConnectionForBotInstance(botInstance.id);
                }, () =>
                {
                    Debug.LogError($"Error starting bot with ID {botId}");
                });
        }));
        RGBotServerListener.GetInstance().SpawnBots();
        
        // Wait until at least one bot is connected. Fail the test if the connection takes too long
        var startTime = DateTime.Now;
        while (!RGBotServerListener.GetInstance().HasBotsRunning())
        {
            var timePassed = DateTime.Now.Subtract(startTime).TotalSeconds;
            if (timePassed > TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS) Assert.Fail($"Bots failed to connect within {TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS} seconds");
            yield return null;
        }
        
        // Now run until all bots complete their tasks
        while (RGBotServerListener.GetInstance().HasBotsRunning())
            yield return null;
        
        // Cleanup when done
        RGBotServerListener.GetInstance()?.StopGame();
    }
    
}

```

At a high level, this test is doing the following:

1. Loading the scene, and waiting for it to start up before activating bots
2. Queuing up a task that will start a bot and spawn it into the scene
3. The test then waits for at least one bot to connects. If a bot does not connect within one minute, the test will fail.
4. Once at least one bot is connected, the test runs until all bots complete their tasks (i.e the bot calls `rg.complete()`)

#### 4. Test it out with an existing bot

Our test is now setup! Before we commit and push our changes, let's test it out locally with an existing bot. To do this, you can
follow the [first bot guide](/studios/unity/tutorials/first_tutorial) or [creating bots reference](/studios/unity/unity-sdk/creating-bots/configuration)
to create and configure a bot. As a quick test, you can make a bot that simply waits for a few seconds before completing it's test. Note
that **having your bot call `rg.complete()` is extremely important! Without this line of code, your bot will run forever!**

```javascript
export function configureBot(rg) {
  // No config for now
}

var startTime = null

export async function processTick(rg) {

  if (!startTime) startTime = new Date().getTime();

  if (new Date().getTime() - startTime > 5000) {
    // Now try to finish
    rg.complete();
  }

}
```

## Viewing Test Results

Once a test is done running, you can see your most recent test results within the Regression Games website, within the **History** tab
of the [Running Bots](https://play.regression.gg/running-bots) page. Within this page, you can download the logs for the run, as well
as the replay file. Follow the instructions at [here](/studios/unity/unity-sdk/in-editor-replay) for viewing this replay in your local
editor. Through the logs and replay feature, you can see errors from the bots, validations, and actions that the bot took.
