# RGState

A component that can be inherited to relay game state information to
Regression Games. Includes a few default pieces of information that can
be enabled from the editor when attached to a GameObject. This is a
MonoBehaviour.

:::info

This component is likely to change soon to be more developer-friendly, by changing the
Dictionary type used to a generic serializable class that you can define.

:::

## Properties

Name | Type  | Description
---|---|---|
`objectType` | `string` | A tag that informs the bot what kind of object this is, such as an `enemy` or `power_up`.  
`syncPosition` | `boolean` | If true, the state relayed will include the position of the object.
`syncRotation` | `boolean` | If true, the state relayed will include the rotation of the object.

## Class Methods

### `public virtual Dictionary<string, object> GetState()`

A function that is overrided to provide the custom state of this specific GameObject.
For example, you may want to retrieve and set the health of a player on the returned
object, or their inventory information. The default implementation returns an empty
dictionary.

#### Arguments

#### Return Value
A dictionary holding additional state for this object

    {
        return new Dictionary<string, object>
        {
