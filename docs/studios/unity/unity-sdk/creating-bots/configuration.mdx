# Configuration

Regression Games Bots are flexible and highly customizable.
Bots can simulate players, function as NPCs, interact with menus and UIs, validate gameplay, and more.
Bots run in the Regression Games runtime and connect to your game via socket connections initiated from your Unity integration.
Each Bot receives the current game state at a regular interval and uses our Javascript API to analyze the state, 
make decisions, and interact with game elements.

## Project Setup

A Bot project is structured as an npm package.

First, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) version 16.x (which can be checked by running `node -v`). 
You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing multiple Node versions installed on a single machine. 

To create your project and install node dependencies, create a new directory and navigate to it, then run the following commands:

```
npm init -y
npm i @types/node node-fetch rg-match-info
```

Finally, create an `index.js` file at your project root. 
This is where you'll implement methods to define the Bot and its behaviors as described in the following sections.  

## Bot Configuration

Your Unity Integration allows flexibility in how your GameObjects are set up, spawned into the scene, and torn down.
The first step to writing your Javascript Bot is defining how these processes should handle this Bot.

The `configureBot(rg)` method accepts an `rg` object which is provided by Regression Games.
This object exposes configuration options (defined in the sections below) and methods for describing Bot behaviors and validations.
The `configureBot` method is optional, but must be exported from your `index.js` file in order for Regression Games to access custom configurations.

```javascript title="index.js"
export function configureBot(rg) {
    rg.isSpawnable = true;
    rg.characterConfig = {
        "role": "enemy",
        "species": "red_imp",
        "immunities": ["fire"],
    };
    rg.lifecycle = "MANAGED";
}
```

### `isSpawnable`

Specifies whether this Bot should be represented by a visible GameObject.
Bots that simulate players or NPCs are generally spawnable, while Bots that interact with menus, 
represent environmental hazards, observe the game state without interaction, etc. are not.

#### Type
`boolean`

#### Default Value
`true`

#### Examples

```javascript 
export function configureBot(rg) {
    rg.isSpawnable = true;
}
```


### `characterConfig`

For spawnable Bots. 
An object containing character configurations to help seat your Bot as the appropriate class/prefab/etc.
This is a freeform object to be interpreted by your game's implementation of the `RGBotSpawnManager.SeatPlayer` and `RGSpawnManager.SpawnBot` interfaces.

#### Type
`object`

#### Default Value
`null`

#### Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="character_config_simple" label="Simple definition" default>

```javascript
export function configureBot(rg) {
    rg.characterConfig = {
        "type" : "Mage"
    };
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="character_type_freeform" label="Complex definition" default>

```javascript
export function configureBot(rg) {
    rg.characterConfig = {
        "role": "Warrior",
        "specialization": "Reaver",
        "startingEquipment": {
            "mainHand": "Sword",
            "offHand": "Sword"
        },
        "spawn": "BlueTower",
        "maxHP": "50"
    };
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### `lifecycle`

Bots can be either `MANAGED` or `PERSISTENT`.
A `MANAGED` Bot will automatically disconnect when `RGBotServerListener.GetInstance()?.StopGame()` is called from the Unity Integration.
A `PERSISTENT` Bot must either terminate itself (see [complete()](./playtest-bots#complete)) when its tasks are complete or be terminated manually from the RG Overlay.
This allows `PERSISTENT` bots to stay active across multiple scenes/sessions. 

#### Type
`string`

#### Default Value
`"MANAGED"`

#### Examples
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="managed_bot" label="Managed" default>

```javascript
export function configureBot(rg) {
    rg.lifecycle = "MANAGED";
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="persistent_bot" label="Persistent" default>

```javascript
export function configureBot(rg) {
    rg.lifecycle = "PERSISTENT";
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
