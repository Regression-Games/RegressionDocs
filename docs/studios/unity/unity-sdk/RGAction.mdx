# Defining Bot Actions

This section refers to an "action" as any instruction the bot can issue to its GameObject.
This can be anything from movement to casting abilities to navigating UI components.

It is common for actions to interact with entities in the [game state](./RGState) and their corresponding GameObjects.
The [`RGFindUtils`](./RGFindUtils) class contains utility functions for finding such GameObjects within the scene and is
useful for these types of actions.

## Defining Actions

Defining an action is as simple as adding the `RGAction` attribute to a method.
This allows the Regression Games SDK to recognize this method as the entrypoint into a callable action from your [bot code](./creating-bots/configuration).

:::info
The `RGAction` attribute can only be used within a component, a class that inherits from `MonoBehavior`, or a class whose parent inherits from `MonoBehavior`.
:::

By default, the name of an action is the same as its method's, but this can be overridden by passing a different name to `RGAction`.
Any parameters that the method accepts will be valid arguments in your bot code.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="action_with_default_name" label="RGAction" default>

```cs
// This is invoked using the name "Jump"

[RGAction]
public void Jump()
{
    _rigidbody.AddForce(Vector3.up * jumpPower, ForceMode.Impulse);
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="action_with_name" label="RGAction with Overridden Name">

```cs
// This is invoked using the name "BigJump" (rather than "DoubleJump").

[RGAction("BigJump")]
public void DoubleJump(int height, UnityEngine.Vector3 position)
{
    Debug.Log("Double Jump");
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `RGAction` attribute is designed for ease of integration.
A method with this attribute may execute an action from start to finish, or it may start an action that `MonoBehavior` methods such as `FixedUpdate` should complete.
Depending on how your code is structured, you may be able to add the `RGAction` attribute to your existing code with minimal refactoring.

## Compiling Actions

The Regression Games SDK will need to process new or updated actions before they can be called by your bot.
