# RGFindUtils

`RGFindUtils` is a singleton providing a set of utility functions for finding GameObjects. This
is extremely useful when implementing [`RGAction`](./RGAction)s that need to find other GameObjects in the scene.

The instance of `RGFindUtils` is automatically created when the scene is loaded, and can be accessed
with the following function:

```cs
RGFindUtils.Instance
```

# Class Methods

### `public T FindOneByInstanceId<T>(int instanceId) where T: MonoBehaviour`

Finds an object of type `T` by its Instance ID. This Instance ID is the ID of the transform for that GameObject.
The type `T` is used to filter and cache objects in the scene of that type for efficient lookup.

#### Arguments
Argument Name | Type | Default | Description
---|---|---|---|
`instanceId` | `int` | required | The instance ID of the GameObject to find. This is often the ID within the state given by
Regression Games.

#### Return Value
The MonoBehaviour of type `T` that has been found in the scene on the GameObject within the given Instance ID.

    var targetObject = RGFindUtils.Instance.FindOneByInstanceId<RGState>(targetInstanceId);
    if (targetObject != null)
    {
        // Set some class variable that is then used in the `Update()` function
        targetTransform = targetObject.transform;
    }
