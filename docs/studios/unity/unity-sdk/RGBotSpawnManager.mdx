# RGBotSpawnManager

The RGBotSpawnManager is the central configuration point for how bots spawn into your Unity Scene.
The class provides default functionality for seating bots as they join, tearing them down, and handling
reconnects. A developer must, at a minimum, must define how bots are spawned into the scene via the
`SpawnBot()` method.

## Abstract Methods

### `[CanBeNull] public abstract GameObject SpawnBot(bool lateJoin, BotInformation botInformation);`

Defines how a bot if spawned into a scene. More specifically, [`botInformation`](./BotInformation) holds the configuration for the bot, 
and you must implement the operations within your scene to instantiate and spawn that bot. That may be 
simply instantiating a prefab, or spawning a NetworkObject into the scene.

#### Arguments

Argument Name | Type | Default | Description
---|---|---|---|
`lateJoin` | `bool` | required | If true, this bot is joining after the game started or after any initial bots have been spawned
`botInformation` | [`BotInformation`](./BotInformation) | required | The id of the client, name of the bot, and a JSON string containing configuration about your bot.

#### Return Value
The instantiated GameObject. This is later used to find and identify the object in your scene that is controlled by your bot.

#### Examples
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="editor_prefab" label="Instantiate from a simple prefab in the editor" default>

```cs
...

[SerializeField]
[Tooltip("The character to spawn")]
private GameObject rgBotPrefab;

[SerializeField]
[Tooltip("Spawn point for RG Bots")]
private Transform botSpawnPoint;

public override GameObject SpawnBot(bool lateJoin, BotInformation botInformation)
{
    var bot = Instantiate(rgBotPrefab, Vector3.zero, Quaternion.identity);
    bot.transform.position = botSpawnPoint.position;
    return bot;
}

...
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="editor_prefab_with_config" label="Instantiate and configure" default>

```cs
...

[SerializeField]
[Tooltip("The character to spawn")]
private GameObject rgBotPrefab;

[SerializeField]
[Tooltip("Spawn point for RG Bots")]
private Transform botSpawnPoint;

public override GameObject SpawnBot(bool lateJoin, BotInformation botInformation)
{
    var bot = Instantiate(rgBotPrefab, Vector3.zero, Quaternion.identity);
    bot.transform.position = botSpawnPoint.position;
    // RGPlayerMoveAction is an RGAction script that we have attached to our prefab, and BotCharacterConfig
    // is a simple serializable class that holds a "speed" field, which is populated from the bot code.
    RGPlayerMoveAction moveAction = bot.GetComponent<RGPlayerMoveAction>();
    BotCharacterConfig config = botInformation.ParseCharacterConfig<BotCharacterConfig>();
    if (config != null)
    {
        Debug.Log($"Changed speed to ${config.speed}");
        moveAction.speed = config.speed;
    }
    return bot;
}

...
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Overridable Virtual Methods

The `RGBotSpawnManager` class has a few methods that can be overridden to further configure how a bot is loaded
and unloaded from a scene.

:::caution

Each of these functions provide important internal implementations that must be called in addition to your
custom code. **Please remember to always call the super/base functions first, which will return objects that
can be further modified.**

:::

### `public virtual void SeatBot(BotInformation botToSpawn)`

A method that gets called before spawning a bot, but after a client has connected. This is useful for seating a 
bot into your game before their prefab has actually spawned - for instance, when choosing a character in a character 
selection screen. This queues the bot to be spawned by the `SpawnBots(bool)` function. You may also override configurations 
provided by the bot using the [`BotInformation.UpdateCharacterConfig<T>(T)`](./BotInformation#public-void-updatecharacterconfigtt-newconfig) method, which sends a new config back to your bot. 
By default, this method does nothing when not implemented.

#### Arguments

Argument Name | Type | Default | Description
---|---|---|---|
`botToSpawn` | [`BotInformation`](./BotInformation) | required | The id of the client, name of the bot, and a JSON string containing configuration about your bot.

#### Return Value

No return value


### `public virtual void TeardownBot(uint clientId)`

A method that gets called when a bot has received a teardown request (i.e. when the bot has signaled that 
it is finished, or when the scene shuts down).

#### Arguments

Argument Name | Type | Default | Description
---|---|---|---|
`clientId` | `uint` | required | The ID of the client that owns the bot to teardown

#### Return Value

No return value

#### Examples
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="editor_prefab" label="Disconnect the character from a network when tearing down" default>

```cs
public override void TeardownBot(uint clientId)
{
    if (BotMap.TryRemove(clientId, out GameObject botObject))
    {
        try
        {
            NetworkObject botOnNetwork = botObject.GetComponent<NetworkObject>();
            botOnNetwork.Despawn(true);
        }
        catch (Exception)
        {
            Debug.Log($"Player already de-spawned");
        }
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### `public virtual void StopGame()`

A method that gets called when the game or scene is terminated. This will remove all bots from the game. 
In most cases, you will not need to override this method, and instead should look at `TeardownBot()`.

#### Arguments

No arguments

#### Return Value

No return value

### `public virtual BotInformation SeatPlayer(uint clientId, string characterConfig, string botName)`

A method that gets called before spawning a player, but after a client has connected. This is
useful for seating a bot into your game before their prefab has actually spawned - for instance,
when choosing a character in a character selection screen. This queues the bot to be spawned by
the `SpawnBots()` function.

#### Arguments

Argument Name | Type | Default | Description
---|---|---|---|
`clientId` | `uint` | required | The ID of the client whose bot is connecting
`characterConfig` | `string` | required | A JSON string that can be used to customize your bot
`botName` | `string` | required | The name of the bot

#### Return Value

A [`BotInformation`](./BotInformation) object that contains the clientId, characterConfig, and botName of the connecting bot.


## Class Methods

The remaining functions mentioned here are not meant to be overridden, but are helpful when
implementing your `SpawnBot` and `SeatPlayer` methods.

### `public GameObject GetBot(uint clientId)`

Returns the GameObject of the bot that belongs to the given `clientId`. Returns null if a bot is not found for the given `clientId`.

#### Arguments

Argument Name | Type | Default | Description
---|---|---|---|
`clientId` | `uint` | required | The ID of the client whose bot you want to find

#### Return Value

The GameObject which encapsulates the bot, or null if the bot is not found

### `public bool IsBotSpawned(uint clientId)`

Returns true if the bot owned by the given clientId has been spawned into the scene, and false otherwise. Equivalent to
checking if `GetBot(clientId) != null`.

#### Arguments

Argument Name | Type | Default | Description
---|---|---|---|
`clientId` | `uint` | required | The ID of the client whose bot you want to find

### `public bool BotsHaveSpawned()`

Returns true if an initial spawn of bots has occurred.

#### Arguments

None

#### Return Value

True if some bots have already been initially spawned

### `public int? GetBotId(uint clientId)`

Returns the Instance ID of the transform for the bot in the scene. This can be used later to reference the bot in the scene

#### Arguments

Argument Name | Type | Default | Description
---|---|---|---|
`clientId` | `uint` | required | The ID of the client that owns the bot to find

#### Return Value

The ID of the bot, or null if it cannot be found
