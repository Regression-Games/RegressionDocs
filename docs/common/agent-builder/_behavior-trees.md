A behavior tree is a decision-making model used to determine which actions an agent (such as a character in a video game) should take in different situations.
You can think of it as a flow chart that the AI thinks through, choosing appropriate actions based on what it knows about itself and its environment.
Behavior trees are composed of nodes organized in a hierarchical structure that start at a root node and branch out to form different paths.
Each path represents a line of decision-making that results in one or more actions for the AI to take.

Each node in the tree executes logic and returns one of the following states as a result:

- **Running** -> The task represented by this node's branch hasn't yet completed.
- **Success** -> The node has completed its task successfully.
- **Failure** -> The node has failed its task. This doesn't necessarily mean an error occurred. For example, a heal action might fail if the character doesn't have any potions.

Different types of nodes have different responsibilities and react differently to the states of other nodes.

- **Root Node**: The beginning of the tree, where the AI starts its decision-making.
  Its job is simply to execute whatever node is below it in the tree and return its state.
- **Sequence Node**: This node has one or more children and acts as a logical AND.
  It executes its child nodes one at a time, and if any of them fail then the Sequence Node immediately fails.
- **Selector Node**: This node also has one or more children, but acts as a logical OR.
  It executes each of its children and if one of them succeeds, then the Selector Node immediately succeeds.
- **Action Node**: This node is a leaf node, meaning it cannot have any children of its own.
  Instead, it represents an action for the AI to take such as moving in a certain direction or interacting with an object in its environment.
- **Condition Node**: This node is also a leaf node. It evaluates whether certain conditions have been satisfied.
- **Decorator Node**: There are several kinds of Decorator Nodes, each of which can have only one child. This node modifies its child's state in some way.
  For example, an "Inverter" Decorator will succeed if its child fails, and vice versa.
