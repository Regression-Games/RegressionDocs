# Authenticating with API Keys

The Regression Games platform provides the ability to generate API keys, which can be used
to authenticate against our API. This is the recommended way to authenticate against our API
when connecting external systems to Regression Games.

You can find the **API Keys** section near the bottom of your [Regression Games account settings](https://play.regression.gg/account).

## Generating an API Key

<CreateAPIKey />

## Using the API Key

Once you have generated an API key, you can use it to authenticate against our API.

### API Requests

Include the key in the `Authorization` header of your request.

```
HEADERS
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
```

### Unity SDK

<SetAPIKeyInUnity />

## Revoking API Keys

You can remove API Keys at any time by deleting them from the **API Keys** manager.
Next to each key is a delete icon, which immediately revokes the key.
