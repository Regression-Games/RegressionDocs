# Authenticating with API Keys

The Regression Games platform provides the ability to generate API keys, which can be used
to authenticate against our API. This is the recommended way to authenticate against our API
when connecting external systems to Regression Games.

You can find the **API Keys** manager at the bottom of your [Regression Games account settings](https://play.regression.gg/account).

## Generating an API Key

Enter a unique name for your key and then click **Generate Key**.
API keys have a default expiration date of 1 year.

:::danger
Make sure to copy the generated key and store it somewhere safe.
Once the success dialog is dismissed, you will never be able to see the generated value through the Regression Games client again!

## Using the API Key

Once you have generated an API key, you can use it to authenticate against our API.

### API Requests

Include the key in the `Authorization` header of your request.

```
HEADERS
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
```

### Unity SDK

In your Unity project, navigate to `Edit` > `Project Settings` > `Regression Games`
and paste your key into the `RG API Key` field.

## Revoking API Keys

You can remove API Keys at any time by deleting them from the **API Keys** manager.
Next to each key is a delete icon, which immediately revokes the key.
