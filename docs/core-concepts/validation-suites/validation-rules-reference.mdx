# Rules Reference

Rules can be asserted when running a Validation Suite against a gameplay recording, to ensure that the recording meets specific criteria. We provide a set of rule types that can be used to construct assertions based on various performance metrics. For each tick in the gameplay recording, all Rules are evaluated. If a Rule is violated the Validation Run will display a warning for that Rule.

## Rule Types

### Frames Per Second (with percentile)

Assert that the frames per second of the gameplay recording do not fall below a threshold, within a specified percentile.

### Average Frames Per Second

Assert that the average frames per second of the gameplay recording does not fall below a threshold. This average is computed
across all frames in a gameplay recording.

### Maximum Frame Time

Assert that the maximum frame time of the gameplay recording does not exceed a threshold. Frame time is the amount of time spent calculating and rendering a frame, and is measured in milliseconds. If a single frame exceeds the specified threshold, the rule will be violated.
