# Gameplay Sessions Technical Reference

Although developers on Regression Games will often interact with the Gameplay Sessions through the web interface or
within the SDK itself, you may be interested in viewing and understanding the data directly. This document provides a
technical overview of the Gameplay Sessions system, as well as more technical details and FAQ.

## Overview of the Schema

#### Game Object State

Within the `state` field, an array of objects represents the state of game objects on this tick. Depending on the
[options you have configured](./gameplay-sessions-usage#advanced-options) for recording, some objects
and state in your scene may not be present in this list.

## RGTestUtils class

The `RGTestUtils` class is a utility class that provides methods for loading and playing back recordings in Unity
Play Mode tests. This class is included in the SDK and can be used to automate the testing of your game.

To use this class, first add `RegressionGames` and `RegressionGames.TestFramework` as references to your test assembly:
![Test assembly references for Regression Games SDK](img/test_assembly_refs.png)

### API

```csharp
namespace RegressionGames
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Utilities for running tests within the Unity Test Runner using Regression Games features.
    /// </summary>
    public class RGTestUtils
    {
        
        /// <summary>
        /// Waits until a specific scene has been loaded, and asserts that it has been loaded
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="sceneName">The name of the scene to wait for</param>
        /// <param name="timeout">The maximum time to wait for the scene to load (in seconds). Defaults to 5.</param>
        public static IEnumerator WaitForScene(string sceneName, int timeout = 5)
        
        /// <summary>
        /// Plays back an existing recording, and then returns the save location of the recording.
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="recordingPath">The path to the recording to play back (the full bot_segments.zip file path)</param>
        /// <param name="setPlaybackResult">A callback that will be called with the results of this playback</param>
        public static IEnumerator StartPlaybackFromFile(string recordingPath, Action<PlaybackResult> setPlaybackResult)
        
    }
}
```

Additionally, the `PlaybackResult` class contains information about the recording playback results, such as the location
of the new recording.

```csharp
namespace RegressionGames.Types
{
    
    [Serializable]
    public class PlaybackResult
    {

        /// <summary>
        /// The location that the playback recording is saved to on disk.
        /// </summary>
        public string saveLocation;
        
    }
    
}
```
