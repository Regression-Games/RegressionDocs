# Gameplay Sessions Technical Reference

Although developers on Regression Games will often interact with the Gameplay Sessions through the web interface or
within the SDK itself, you may be interested in viewing and understanding the data directly. This document provides a
technical overview of the Gameplay Sessions system, as well as more technical details and FAQ.

## Overview of the Schema

#### Game Object State

Within the `state` field, an array of objects represents the state of game objects on this tick. Depending on the
[options you have configured](./gameplay-sessions-usage#advanced-options) for recording, some objects
and state in your scene may not be present in this list.
