# Recording Gameplay

The [RGOverlayCanvas](../getting-started/installing-regression-games#add-the-regression-games-overlay-to-your-scene)
allows you to record game state and user inputs as you play through your game.
This information can be used to [automatically replay the scenario](#replaying-recordings),
validate game behaviour with [Validation Suites](./validation-suites),
and form the basis of complex [Bot Sequences](./bot-sequences/getting-started-with-bot-sequences-and-segments).

At a high level, the SDK captures the following information during gameplay:
* Entities and their state (e.g. position, behaviours, colliders)
* Performance information (e.g. frame rate, memory usage)
* User input (e.g. keyboard, mouse, gamepad)
* Screenshots

The SDK captures this information once every **tick**.
A tick is a snapshot of the game state at a given point in time.
One or more frames may elapse between two ticks, depending on the configured [tick interval](#tick-interval).
Ticks are important to understand when working with the SDK, as they are used to visualize changes in the game state over time.

## Creating a Recording

:::info
Recording requires the [RGOverlayCanvas](../getting-started/installing-regression-games#add-the-regression-games-overlay-to-your-scene)
to be present in your scene.
:::

Press the **Record** icon in the RG Toolbar while in "Play" mode to start recording gameplay.
The icon will pulse to signal that a recording is in progress, and our SDK will begin capturing game state and user inputs.

![Start Recording](img/recording-gameplay/start-recording.png)


Click the **Record** icon again to stop the recording and save captured data to your local device.
If you have provided a valid [API Key in the RG Settings](../getting-started/installing-regression-games#configure-your-api-key),
then a copy of the captured data will also be uploaded to your Regression Games account as a [Gameplay Session](gameplay-sessions).
Gameplay Sessions unlock access to more features through the Regression Games web interface such as [Validation Suites](validation-suites).

## Replaying Recordings

Replaying a recording reproduces each tick in the original recording in order.
This involves simulating the inputs from the original recording, and waiting for key values in the game state to match expectations for that tick
before continuing to the next set of inputs in the recording.
The SDK records the state of the game while a replay is in progress, and saves the replay data as a new recording and Gameplay Session.

Replay, and recording the replay, can be useful for identifying areas of your game that behave inconsistently
given the same inputs, reproducing transient bugs and collecting debug information for them,
or ensuring that changes to your game don't break gameplay.

:::tip
Replaying a recording file works best in deterministic or mostly-deterministic scenarios.
For example, navigating menus tends to be deterministic, while the locations and movements of NPCs may not be.
The replay tool attempts to account for some inconsistencies, but it is not perfect.
For games with a high degree of randomness or non-determinism, we recommend using recordings as a basis to
create your own customized [Bot Sequences](bot-sequences/getting-started-with-bot-sequences-and-segments)
rather than relying on raw recordings themselves.
:::

### Starting a Replay

There are two ways to initiate a replay of an existing recording:
manually select a recording via the overlay, or programmatically start a recording using utilities from our SDK.

#### Manual Replay

Press the **Menu** icon in the RG Toolbar while in "Play" mode to select a recording to replay.
This will launch a file explorer at the location of the [recordings directory](#recording-directory) on your device.
Navigate into the folder of the recording you'd like to replay, select its `bot_segments.zip` file, and then click **Load Replay**.

#### Programmatic Replay

The `RGTestUtils` class provides methods for replaying recordings programmatically.
This is intended for use in
[Play Mode tests for the Unity Test Runner](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@1.4/manual/index.html).

:::info
The `RegressionGames` and `RegressionGames.TestFramework` assemblies must be listed as
references in your test assembly to use the `RGTestUtils` class.

<img src={TestAssemblyRefs} alt="Test assembly references for Regression Games SDK" style={{display: "block", margin: "auto"}}/>
:::

:::tip
By default, [recordings are saved outside your project](#recorded-data-formats).
Make sure you copy the recordings you'd like to replay into your project
to ensure they'll be available on other machines that run these automated tests.
:::

Create a `UnityTest` that invokes the `RGTestUtils.StartPlaybackFromZipFile` method.
Pass the path to your recording's `bot_segments.zip` file.
This will replay the recording, wait until playback is complete, and then save the replay as a new recording.
You can add additional logic to your test to validate the game state at the end of playback,
or use a recording to reach a known state in your game for further testing.

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using RegressionGames;
using RegressionGames.Types;
using UnityEngine.Assertions;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;
using UnityEngine.TestTools;

public class RecordingTest
{

    [UnityTest]
    public IEnumerator TestRecording()
    {

        // Unity has a macOS bug that prints errors when taking screenshots during recording.
        // This line prevents the test from failing when these errors are logged.
#if UNITY_EDITOR_OSX || UNITY_RUNTIME_OSX
        LogAssert.ignoreFailingMessages = true;
#endif

        // Define which recording to use
        string recordingPath = System.IO.Path.Combine(System.IO.Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), "Assets/Tests/Runtime/Recordings/MainMenuRecording.zip");

        // Wait for the scene to load
        SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync("Startup", LoadSceneMode.Single);
        yield return RGTestUtils.WaitForScene("MainMenu");

        // Start playback
        // This will automatically create a new recording of the replay
        PlaybackResult playbackResult = null;
        yield return RGTestUtils.StartPlaybackFromZipFile(recordingPath, result => playbackResult = result);

        // Print out the recording path for viewing later
        RGDebug.LogInfo("Played back and recorded the test run - saved to " + playbackResult.saveLocation);
        Assert.IsNotNull(playbackResult.saveLocation);

    }
}
```

### Game State Errors During Replay

The replay tool attempts to reproduce each tick in the original recording in order.
This involves simulating the original user inputs, and waiting for key values in the game state to match expectations for that tick.
If the game state does not match a set of key expectations set by the original recording after a certain timeout,
then the replay will pause itself and display a warning above the RG Toolbar with the list of unmet expectations.
Replay will continue from where it left off if the warning is resolved.

<img src={ReplayError} alt="Errors During Replay" style={{display: "block", margin: "auto"}}/>

## Recorded Data Formats

Recordings are located in the configured [recording directory](#recording-directory) on your local device.

A recording folder contains multiple files that provide important context about the game's state.
All of this same data is saved to the [Gameplay Session](gameplay-sessions) that is uploaded
to your Regression Games account at the end of a recording.
Expand the sections below to learn more about our raw data formats.

## Advanced Configuration

The SDK provides a number of options to configure how game state and user inputs are recorded.
These options can be found under components attached to the `RGOverlayCanvas` GameObject in your scene.

<img src={AdvancedConfiguration} alt="Advanced Configuration Options" style={{display: "block", margin: "auto"}}/>

### Adjusting the Recording Interval

The **Recording Min FPS** value in the `ScreenRecorder` component controls how often the SDK
scrapes the game state and captures that data as a tick.

The default value for this setting is `0`, which means the SDK will capture a tick whenever it detects an important change in the game state.
Allowing the SDK to determine key state changes is sufficient for most games,
but you can set a regular interval for capturing ticks instead by adjusting the `Recording Min FPS` value on the `ScreenRecorder` component.
Setting the value above `0` will cause the SDK to record that many ticks each second.

### Overriding the Recording Directory

The **State Recordings Directory** path in the `ScreenRecorder` component controls which directory on your local
device recordings will be saved to.

By default, the SDK saves recordings to your user's home directory under `unity_videos`.
Whatever path you provide will be used as the root directory instead.

Beneath the root directory, the SDK gives each Unity project its own subdirectory matching the project's `Application.productName`.
Recordings are saved under these project subdirectories as a folders named `recording_{MM-dd-yyyy_HH.mm}_{sessionId}`.
For example, the default location for a recording from a project named "MyGame" will be located at:

```bash
# macOS & Linux
~/unity_videos/MyGame/recording_08-30-2024_14.34_0b8551

# Windows
C:\Users\{MyUser}\unity_videos\MyGame\recording_08-30-2024_14.34_0b8551
```

### Adjusting Input Thresholds

The **Key Held Threshold Seconds** value in the `Keyboard Input Action Observer` component controls how long a key must be released
between presses before each press is considered a distinct key-down event.

Some devices might erroneously recognize a held key as spamming key-down events for that key.
This setting defaults to `0.1` seconds, and on Windows should not have to be changed.
If you experience spammy key clicks on macOS or other platforms that handle key events in a non-standard way,
then you may need to increase this value.

### Including and Excluding GameObjects from Data Capture

The SDK captures data for all GameObjects in the scene hierarchy that are visible to the camera and have a renderer.
This can result in a lot of data being captured every tick, depending on the complexity of your scene.

You can **exclude** a GameObject from being captured by attaching the `RGExcludeFromState` component to it.
Excluding a GameObject will also exclude its children from data capture.
This can be useful for ignoring entire regions of a level or individual objects that are not relevant to your testing scenarios.

You can **include** GameObjects that are not visible to the camera or otherwise not rendered by adding the `RGIncludeInState` component to them.
This can be useful for always capturing data for important objects, regardless of whether they appear on-screen.
