A **Gameplay Session** is a recorded snippet of gameplay from your game.
The Regression Games SDK captures the following information during gameplay:

- Entities and their state (e.g. position, behaviours, colliders)
- Performance information (e.g. frame rate, memory usage)
- User input (e.g. keyboard, mouse, gamepad)
- Screenshots

This recorded information allows the Regression Games SDK to automatically replay a given session
and run user-defined test scenarios against new data captured during the replay.
This effectively brings the power of automated testing to the world of game development.

A Gameplay Session can be recorded within Unity either programmatically or through an overlay provided by the SDK.
The recording is saved locally to your device as you record, and is synced to your Regression Games account when you stop recording.
A saved recording can be loaded to reproduce inputs and capture new information from the replay.

## Strengths of the Gameplay Session system

- **Easy to use**: Start and stop recordings with a single click. Instantly start scraping in-depth information about your game
  with minimal integration.
- **Performance**: We've taken extra care to ensure that our SDK introduces minimal load on gameplay performance.
  This is something we are constantly improving.
- **Customization**: In some cases, you may want to ignore certain parts of your game's state. The SDK makes it easy
  to exclude a GameObject and its children from recorded data.

## Known Limitations

We are constantly iterating on and improving our tools!

- **Old vs New Unity Input System** - Playback of recordings is currently supported only for games using the new Unity
  Input System. _We are investigating the possibility of supporting the old Unity Input System_.
