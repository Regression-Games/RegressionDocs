**Gameplay Sessions** are recordings of a play-through within your game. The Regression Games SDK captures
information from the game during the play-through, including:

- Entities and their state (e.g. position, behaviours, colliders)
- Performance information (e.g. frame rate, memory usage)
- User input (e.g. keyboard, mouse, gamepad)
- Screenshots

These recordings are used for two purposes:

1. Capturing data from the game that is useful for testing, such as validating state, performance information, etc.
2. Replaying the session automatically as an automated test scenario.

A Gameplay Sessions recording can be started either through the the Regression Games Overlay or programmatically. The
recording is saved locally to your device, but is later uploaded to your Regression Games account. A saved recording
can be selected through the overlay or programmatically to play back as an automation.

## Strengths of the Gameplay Session system

- **Easy to use**: Start and stop recordings with a single click. No additional code setup is needed, and instantly
  start scraping in-depth information about your game.
- **Performance**: Extra care has been taking to ensure that the SDK introduces minimal performance load on the
  gameplay. This is something we are constantly improving.
- **Customization**: In some cases, you may want to ignore certain parts of your game's state. The SDK makes this easy
  by providing a component that can be added to any game object or tree of objects to ignore those objects from the
  scraping step.

## Known Limitations

We are constantly iterating on and improving our tools! If you have additional limitations, bugs, or feature requests
you'd like to send along, please fill out [this feedback form.](https://d7y6yysps34.typeform.com/to/MYieIsHV)

- **Old vs New Unity Input System** - For **playback specifically**, only games using the new Unity Input System are
  supported, as the old Unity Input System does not easily support input simulation.
