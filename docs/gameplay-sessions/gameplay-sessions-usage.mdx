# Using Gameplay Sessions

## Preparing the Overlay

The Regression Games SDK's `RGOverlayCanvasV2` prefab is a UI component that will allow you to record and replay Gameplay
Sessions.

<OverlayPartial />

## Recording Gameplay

Once the overlay has been added to your scene(s), click play.
The Regression Games logo at the bottom of the Scene View will display recording and playback controls.

Recording can be started by clicking the red "record" button below the logo.
Once clicked, the SDK will begin recording your gameplay. You can tell that recording is active when the red button begins pulsing.
Clicking the button again will stop the recording and sync the Gameplay Session to your Regression Games account.

## Playing Back a Recording

A recording can be replayed by initiating "play" mode from your Unity editor and selecting the menu button below the Regression Games logo.
This will launch a file explorer at the location of the recordings folder on your device.
Navigate into the folder of the recording you'd like to replay, select its `data.zip` file, and then click "Load Replay".
Once you've selected a replay, click the Play button below the Regression Games logo to begin playback.

## Advanced Options

### Choosing an FPS for recording

The `Recording Min FPS` field under `RGOverlayCanvasV2` > `ScreenRecorder` allows you to configure
how often the SDK scrapes the game for state data.
Its default value is 0, which instructs the SDK to only record state data when it detects a
[**key frame**](/gameplay-sessions/gameplay-sessions-reference#key-frames).
Setting `Recording Min FPS` to a value greater than 0 will cause the SDK to record data at that frequency instead,
regardless of whether a key frame was detected.
For instance, a setting of `5` will result in the SDK scraping the game for state data 5 times per second.

### Changing your recording location

By default, recorded data is stored in your home directory under `/unity_videos`.
This directory can be overridden by changing the `State Recordings Directory` field under `RGOverlayCanvasV2` > `ScreenRecorder`.

### Input threshold options

Some devices might recognize holding down a key as spamming key presses for that key instead.
The `Key Held Threshold Seconds` field under `RGOverlayCanvasV2` > `Keyboard Input Action Observer`
allows you to configure the threshold for how long a key must be released
between presses before each press is considered a distinct event.
This setting defaults to 0.1 seconds, and often should not need to be changed.
If you do experience key-press spam, increase the value.

### Configuring game-state collection

The Regression Games SDK scrapes the game for state data by traversing the game's GameObject hierarchy
and recording any data it considers relevant to playing back recordings or running tests.

#### Excluding objects from recordings

Adding the `RGExcludeFromState` component to a GameObject will prevent its state data from being recorded.
This can be useful for ignoring irrelevant regions of a level
or other objects that are not relevant to your playback or testing.
Children of an excluded GameObject are also excluded from the recording, effectively ignoring the entire hierarchy.

#### Collapsing renderers

By default, the SDK collapses a child GameObject's data into its respective top-level GameObject.
If a GameObject hierarchy has colliders/renderers/animators/etc. at multiple levels,
they will be represented together as a single "entity" in the recorded state.
This is generally desirable, as it allows you to treat each player (for example) as a complete entity in the state
rather than visualizing individual child components as their own entities.

However, it can also be useful to disable this behaviour in cases where you'd like to validate
render bounds, colliders, rigid bodies, etc. for individual armatures, weapons, or other components
on children in the hierarchy.

The `Collapse Renderers into Top Level Game Object` checkbox under `RGOverlayCanvasV2` > `In Game Object Finder`
controls this behaviour, where checking the box forces collapsing and unchecking the box disables collapsing.

#### Include off-camera objects

By default, the SDK only records state data for GameObjects that are within the main camera's viewport.
In many cases, this is desirable because off-camera GameObjects are not relevant to playback or applicable test scenarios.
Off-camera objects can be included in recordings by toggling the
`Include Only On Camera Objects` checkbox under `RGOverlayCanvasV2` > `In Game Object Finder`.
Checking this box limits state collection to on-camera objects
and unchecking the box enables state collection for off-camera objects.

#### Collect state from behaviours

By default, the SDK only records state data from GameObjects themselves, and does not record
fields or property values from attached Behaviours.
These are generally not needed for playing back recordings, but can be extremely useful for test scenarios.

The `Collect State from Behaviours` checkbox under `RGOverlayCanvasV2` > `In Game Object Finder`
dictates whether recordings include data from Behaviours attached to a GameObject.
Checking this box will include all fields and properties from all Behaviours attached to a GameObject in the recorded state,
and unchecking the box will exclude them.

:::info Note

Recording state from Behaviours may incur an impact on performance.
