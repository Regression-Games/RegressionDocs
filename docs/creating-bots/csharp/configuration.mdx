# Configuration

Regression Games Bots are flexible and highly customizable.
Bots can simulate players, function as NPCs, interact with menus and UIs, validate gameplay, and more.
Bots run in separate threads in Unity and communicate with your game via state and action messages.
Each Bot receives the current game state at a regular interval and uses our C# API to analyze the state, 
make decisions, and interact with game elements via actions.

## Project Setup

Each Unity C# bot is a collection of scripts and assets inside your project.

You can create a new bot by using the `Regression Games -> Create New Bot` menu option in Unity.

New bots are created inside your project at `Assets/RegressionGames/Runtime/Bots/{BotName}_{BotId}`.
  - This directory can be renamed, but should match the namespace used in the `.cs` files for your bot as explained below.

Each new bot is created with 2 files.
  - `BotRecord.asset` which defines key information about the bot like `name` and `id`  
    - This file is used when starting bots in Unity to properly identify bots by their `id` irrespective of their namespace or directory name.
    - This file is also used when you synchronize local Unity bots with Regression Games servers.
  - `BotEntryPoint.cs` which extends `RGUserBot.cs` and defines the main C# script entry points for your bot. This is used by the Regression Games SDK to launch and communicate with the bot.
    - The system requires the namespace of `BotEntryPoint.cs` and all other `.cs` files for your bot to be the same.  The namespace must follow one of the conventions listed below.  This is important so that different bots' namespaces do not conflict and so that the system knows the correct namespace to load each bot's code from.
      - The namespace can be `{botName}_{botId}`, where negative botIds have replaced the `-` sign with the letter `n`
        - OR
      - The namespace can match the name of the folder the bot is in

You may add as many additional scripts or dependencies to your bot as necessary, but the 2 files above MUST exist for your bot to work correctly.

## Bot Configuration

Your Unity Integration allows flexibility in how your GameObjects are set up, spawned into the scene, and torn down.
The first step to writing your C# Bot is defining how these processes should handle this Bot.

The `ConfigureBot(RG rgObject)` method accepts an `RG` object which is provided by Regression Games.
This object exposes configuration options (defined in the sections below) and methods for describing Bot behaviors and validations.
Implementing the `ConfigureBot` method is optional, but should be implemented when you want to configure your bot before processing the first tick.

For spawnable Bots, `rgObject.CharacterConfig` is an object containing character configurations to help seat your Bot as the appropriate class/prefab/etc.
This is a freeform object to be interpreted by your game's implementation of the
[`RGBotSpawnManager.SeatBot`](../../integrating-with-unity/seating-and-spawning-bots#public-virtual-void-seatbotbotinformation-bottospawn)
and [`RGSpawnManager.SpawnBot`](../../integrating-with-unity/seating-and-spawning-bots#canbenull-public-abstract-gameobject-spawnbotbool-latejoin-botinformation-botinformation) interfaces.

{
    rgObject.CharacterConfig = new Dictionary<string, object>() {
        { "role", "Warrior" },
        { "specialization", "Reaver" },
        { "startingEquipment", new Dictionary<string, object>()
            {
                { "mainHand", "Sword" },
                { "offHand", "Sword" }
            }
        },
        { "spawn", "BlueTower" },
        { "maxHP", 50 },
        { "immunities", new string[] { "fire" } }
    };
}
```

### `IsSpawnable`

Specifies whether this Bot should be represented by a visible GameObject.
Bots that simulate players or NPCs are generally spawnable, while Bots that interact with menus, 
represent environmental hazards, observe the game state without interaction, etc. are not.

```javascript 
protected override bool GetIsSpawnable()
{
    return true;
}
```

### `BotLifecycle`

Bots can be either `MANAGED` or `PERSISTENT`.
A `MANAGED` Bot will automatically disconnect when `RGBotServerListener.GetInstance()?.StopGame()` is called from the Unity Integration.
A `PERSISTENT` Bot must either terminate itself (see [complete()](dynamic-decision-making#complete)) when its tasks are complete or be terminated manually from the RG Overlay.
This allows `PERSISTENT` bots to stay active across multiple scenes/sessions. 

#### Examples
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="managed_bot" label="Managed" default>

```javascript
protected override RGBotLifecycle GetBotLifecycle()
{
    return RGBotLifecycle.MANAGED;
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="persistent_bot" label="Persistent" default>

```javascript
protected override RGBotLifecycle GetBotLifecycle()
{
    return RGBotLifecycle.PERSISTENT;
}
```
